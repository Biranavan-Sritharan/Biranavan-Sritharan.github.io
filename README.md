# Disease Prediction Webpage

## Summary
A disease prediction webpage using machine learning to calculate probabilities using Naive Bayes.

PLEASE NOTE, using the online github repository rather than the zip file will give the most up to date version and reduces the risk of running into any potential errors when setting up the files in your own code editor (which there should not be any problems). Also please view the webpage at an 80% zoom level for best experience and to avoid any graphical issues*

## Requirements:

An internet connection is required to run this webpage since the program fetches the datasets from the github repository directly and not locally!
If you decide to view this in your code editor, please install a way to host a live server from your machine. 
The one used in this project was the Live Server Extension on VSCode published by Ritwick Dey.
You can also try manually hosting your server in the terminal if this does not work

NOTE: the rest of this section is for setting up the discarded programs that are not part of the final project, more for looking at previous works and progress over time.
Also if you are planning on running any of the unused files, note they will not be able to work due to not having any datasets attached to a github repository, however if you still wish to proceed with this, then there are a few libraries that will need to be installed for both Javascript and Python versions.

### For Python programs:

Set up a virtual environment using the command in the terminal (preferably in your code editor that is running the program):

```console
python -m venv venv
```

This will create a venv folder to appear in your program folder, from here run this line in the terminal:

venv/Scripts/activate

Now we can begin installing the python libraries required, which is just one, and the way to install this is to type again into the terminal this line:

pip install pandas

### For javascript programs:
This is much simpler, some javascript programs require the json2csv and csv2json packages and to install this type the following into the terminal in your code editor:

npm install csv2json
npm install json2csv

But please note that these venv set ups or npm package installations is for unused or discarded programs, the actual final project does not have any pre-requisites.
